27.276813|31.58314|The past, and the chase
32.198031|34.358303|You hunted me down
34.705961|38.839377|Like a wolf, a predator
39.582353|43.761593|I felt like a deer in love lights
47.02311|53.3158|You loved me and I froze in time
54.616008|60.814216|Hungry for that flesh of mine
61.813588|69.115649|But I can't compete with a she wolf who has brought me to my knees

113.392375|115.77222|The thrill of the kill
116.132099|119.857976|You feel, is a sin
120.729263|127.752708|I lay with the wolves, alone it seems
